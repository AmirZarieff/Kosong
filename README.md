### **Project Details**

1. **Title**
   
   RecycleMate – Smart Recycling Helper App

2. **Background of the Problem**
   
   Although recycling is encouraged worldwide, many adults still struggle to understand what can and cannot be recycled. Items like plastic containers, packaging, paper, and glass are often thrown into the wrong bin due to confusion. Incorrect sorting leads to contamination, making recyclable materials unusable and contributing to higher landfill waste. Adults may want to recycle, but inconsistent rules and lack of clear information make it difficult. A simple mobile app that gives instant guidance can help people recycle correctly and support environmental sustainability.

3. **Purpose / Objective**
   
   RecycleMate aims to help adults make smarter and more environmentally friendly waste disposal decisions. The main objectives are:

   * Identify whether an item is recyclable, non-recyclable, or requires special handling.
   * Provide correct disposal instructions in a simple and clear manner.
   * Educate users with recycling tips and common mistakes to avoid.
   * Encourage consistent recycling habits using a built-in tracking system.
   * Offer a fast and convenient tool that supports sustainable lifestyle choices.

4. **Target Users**
   
   The app is designed for adults aged 18–60, especially:

   * Homeowners
   * Working adults
   * Parents
   * People who manage household waste
   * Anyone who wants clearer recycling information

5. **Preferred Platform**
   **Flutter (Android)** – chosen because:

   * Enables fast UI design with built-in widgets.
   * Integrates well with Firebase Authentication & Cloud Firestore.
   * Supports required packages, plugins, and state management.
   * Cross-platform (Android → iOS future-ready).
   * Matches course requirement to use Flutter + Backend as a Service.

6. **Features and Functionalities**

   a. **User Authentication (Firebase)**

      * Register, login, logout
      * Email/password authentication
      * Form validation & error handling

   b. **Item Scanner & Classification**

      * Use phone camera to scan items
      * Identify item type (plastic, paper, glass, metal, food packaging)
      * Display appropriate disposal instructions

   c. **Manual Search Feature**

      * Search for items using text input
      * Returns correct recycling method
      * Firestore integration for item data

   d. **Recycling Tips & Educational Content**

      * Do’s and don’ts
      * Common recycling mistakes
      * Eco-friendly lifestyle suggestions

   e. **Recycling Activity Tracker**

      * Users log items they recycle
      * Weekly/monthly progress summary
      * Motivational eco-progress charts

   f. **Firebase Firestore Storage (CRUD)**

      * Store user profile, scan history, search history, activity logs
      * All features use Create, Read, Update & Delete operations

   g. **Clean & Consistent UI/UX**

      * Clear icons and labeling
      * Simple navigation layout
      * Consistent color theme and screen structure

**How We Came Up With the App Idea:**

Our group wanted to develop an app that solves a real-world problem while being achievable using Flutter. Recycling confusion is a common issue among adults, leading to incorrect waste management and environmental pollution. RecycleMate helps adults recycle confidently with instant guidance and helpful learning features. The app fits the course requirements because it uses packages, plugins, authentication, backend storage, CRUD operations, and well-structured UI/UX principles. It also provides an opportunity for each group member to implement equally challenging tasks.
